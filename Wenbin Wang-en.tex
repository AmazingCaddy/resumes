	\textbf{Intelligent Customer Service}\\

	\begin{justify} 
		This system allows users to train their own intelligent chatbot customer service. By combining with manually configured customer service, it provides a complete intelligent customer service solution. I led a team of 2 people to design and develop the entire system from scratch, excluding the AI algorithms. My main responsibilities included:
	\end{justify}

	\smallskip

	\vspace*{-8pt}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items

	\textbf{Xiaoxing Assistant} \\

	\begin{justify} 
		This service is based on a large language model and allows users to upload documents for the chatbot to learn the content, providing question-and-answer services based on the document's content. My main responsibilities included:
	\end{justify}
	\smallskip

	\vspace*{-8pt}

	\textbf{Xingyuan AI + RPA Low-code Platform} \\

	\begin{justify} 
		The platform provides a graphical BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram creation tool (Xingyuan Studio), rich AI modules and runtime environment, RPA (Robotic Process Automation) instructions and runtime environment. This allows ordinary implementation engineers to quickly create AI+RPA processes that meet customer needs and deploy them as AI applications or RPA tasks. It reduces the development costs of AI algorithms and RPA processes. The platform consists of more than 10 components, and I am responsible for the development of six services, including the Management Center, User Center, Xingyuan Store, Application Engine, Data Reports, and Publishing Tools. The remaining components include AI runtime, RPA Management Center, RPA Workstation, Xingyuan Studio, Xingyuan Assistant, etc. I also participated in the design of AI runtime version 3. In this version, to improve GPU utilization and concurrency of the AI runtime, the execution granularity of the GPU was reduced from the process diagram level to the module level. However, due to company development direction issues, it was ultimately not implemented.
	\end{justify} 
	
	\medskip

	\textbf{Intelligent Audit} \\

	\begin{justify} 
	 	This service is primarily targeted at government approval agencies. It utilizes AI algorithms to convert unstructured data (such as image files) into structured data. Combined with audit rules, the system can quickly assess whether a set of documents complies with all rule requirements, thereby reducing manual costs. My main responsibilities included:
