	\begin{justify}
		I led a 5-person R\&D team, successfully completing the development of multiple products and projects from inception. This includes the development of an intelligent customer service system, Xingyuan Assistant (\url{https://xiaoxing.meinenghua.com}), Xingyuan AI+RPA low-code platform, and intelligent auditing services. Throughout the entire work period, in addition to front-end and back-end development, I was responsible for requirement communication, system design, decision-making on design solutions, and the formulation of development plans. I led the team to successfully deliver products on time, demonstrating the ability to balance and make trade-offs among various factors, including functionality, technology, and cost.\\
		Furthermore, I led the operations team, overseeing Saas operations and customer private deployment for over 100 B2B clients. Addressing the need for private deployment for B2B clients, I participated in the development of an offline deployment tool based on Docker and Kubernetes. This tool resolved the universality issues of Docker images, reducing deployment and operational costs.

	\textbf{Intelligent Customer Service}\\

	\begin{justify} 
		This system allows users to train their intelligent chatbot customer service, combining with customer service to provide a complete intelligent customer service solution. I led a team to design and develop the entire system from scratch, excluding AI algorithms part. The system includes the following components:
	\end{justify}

	\smallskip

	\vspace*{-8pt}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
		\item \begin{justify} 
			User authentication and permission module, supporting integration with the client's user system for login.
		\end{justify} 
	\end{itemize}

	\vspace*{-8pt}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
		\item \begin{justify}
			Robot management interface with functionalities for managing both the chatbot and human customer service. It includes features for managing Q\&A libraries, lexicons, annotating and training historical conversation messages, and generating data reports.
		\end{justify} 
	\end{itemize}

	\vspace*{-8pt}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
		\item \begin{justify} 
			User interface and customer service interface that utilize WebSocket for bidirectional communication. Redis was used to maintain user and customer service states, session states, and implements features such as manual customer service assignment, and user idle detection.
		\end{justify}
	\end{itemize}

	\vspace*{-8pt}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
		\item \begin{justify}
			Middleware for chatbot dialogue and dialogue engine to unify inconsistencies caused by different underlying algorithms, facilitating the integration and replacement of underlying algorithms.
		\end{justify} 
	\end{itemize}

	\vspace*{-8pt}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
		\item \begin{justify}
			Implemented an offline data reporting service that, by sacrificing a certain level of real-time performance (5 minutes), improves the query performance of data reports.
		\end{justify} 
	\end{itemize}

	\medskip

	\textbf{Xiaoxing Assistant} \\

	\begin{justify} 
		This service is based on a large language model and allows users to upload documents for the chatbot to learn the content, providing question-and-answer services based on the document's content. My main responsibilities included:
	\end{justify}
	\smallskip

	\vspace*{-8pt}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
		\item \begin{justify} 
			Led a team of 5 members, focused on market expansion needs, designed product features, formulated development plans, and ensured the rapid iteration of the product.

		\end{justify} 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\medskip

	\textbf{Xingyuan AI+RPA Low-code Platform} \\

	\begin{justify} 
		The platform provides a graphical BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram creation tool (Xingyuan Studio), rich AI modules and runtime environment, RPA (Robotic Process Automation) instructions and runtime environment. This allows ordinary implementation engineers to quickly create AI+RPA processes that meet customer needs and deploy them as AI applications or RPA tasks. It reduces the development costs of AI algorithms and RPA processes. The platform consists of more than 10 components, and I am responsible for the development of six services, including the Management Center, User Center, Xingyuan Store, Application Engine, Data Reports, and Publishing Tools. The remaining components include AI runtime, RPA Management Center, RPA Workstation, Xingyuan Studio, Xingyuan Assistant, etc. I also participated in the design of AI runtime version 3, which lowered the granularity of GPU execution from the process diagram level to the module level, providing better concurrency capabilities and reducing overall costs.
	\end{justify} 
	
	\medskip

	\textbf{Intelligent Audit} \\

	\begin{justify} 
	 	This service is primarily targeted at government approval agencies. It utilizes AI algorithms to convert unstructured data (such as image files) into structured data. Combined with audit rules, the system can quickly assess whether a set of documents complies with all rule requirements, thereby reducing manual costs. My main responsibilities included:
	\end{justify}
